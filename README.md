# 👋 Hey, I’m Ayush!  

Just a 17-year-old guy figuring out Python and life, one line of code at a time. I’ve always been curious about how things work, whether it’s the mechanics of a black hole or the logic behind a simple script.  

- 🌱 Right now, I’m learning Python from the ground up.  
- 🎯 My short-term goal? Build cool, beginner-friendly projects.  
- ❤️ When I’m not coding, I’m diving into the rich heritage of Rajputana and embracing its timeless stories and culture.  

Here’s the deal: I’m here to learn, make mistakes, and grow. If you’re on the same journey, let’s connect. We might just build something awesome together.
